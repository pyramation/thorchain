/**
 * The severity of the event described in a log entry, expressed as one of the
 * standard severity levels listed below.  For your reference, the levels are
 * assigned the listed numeric values. The effect of using numeric values other
 * than those listed is undefined.
 *
 * You can filter for log entries by severity.  For example, the following
 * filter expression will match log entries with severities `INFO`, `NOTICE`,
 * and `WARNING`:
 *
 *     severity > DEBUG AND severity <= WARNING
 *
 * If you are writing log entries, you should map other severity encodings to
 * one of these standard levels. For example, you might map all of Java's FINE,
 * FINER, and FINEST levels to `LogSeverity.DEBUG`. You can preserve the
 * original severity level in the log entry payload if you wish.
